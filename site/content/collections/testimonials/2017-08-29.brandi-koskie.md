  I have thoroughly enjoyed being able to work with Matt. I knew he was the guy for us when he was still contracting and not yet full-time. He was so thoughtful about our process and generous with his ideas; something a freelancer typically guards closely.
  
  Matt was a team player from the start and never showed anything less. He’s meticulous in his process and approach. I’d jump at the chance to work with him again in the future. He’s an all-around good guy and we’ve been fortunate to have him on our team at Clover Partners.
