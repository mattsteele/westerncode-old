  As a designer, it’s always a gift to have a developer who can easily cross disciplines and offer valuable input and skill in making a project seamless. Matt has been this and so much more for our team. Even while contracting with us, he quickly became part of the team—investing whole-heartedly in the work.
  
  Matt has been the ultimate team player, willing to put in more than expected on projects and consistently showing expertise and attention to detail. I would absolutely look forward to the chance to work with Matt again in the future.
