# Sidecar License

- When in doubt regarding the terms outlined below, err on the side of being awesome.
- Focus Lab, LLC retains the right to verbally and digitally talk about your use of Sidecar products if the use is visible to the public in some way.


## You may

- Use the products in any number of personal projects
- Use the products in any number of commercial projects
- Use the products without attribution to Sidecar (but a shout-out would be rad if you're into that kinda thing)
- Modify or manipulate the products as needed
- Combine the products with other works
- Brag about how you made a smart decision to buy and use these products


## You may not

- Redistribute, resell, lease, license, or sublicense Sidecar products

## Lastly, a few respectful requests

We cannot and don't want to track the following itemsâ€”but we respectfully request that you:

- Do not share your purchased files with others outside of your organization.
- Do tell a friend about Sidecar if our products or content have helped you in any way.
- Do help your fellow designer when they need it and you can offer it.
